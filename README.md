### Authors: Marcus Daly, Kai Wang, Mitran Kwatra, Jacob Rich
## Introduction
This Repository is the main repository for the game "The Coliny Migration". The original version of this game was created for the class EECS 290 at Case Western Reserve University. The game is programmed in Unity and is now primarily targeted for mobile, although still playable on desktop.

## The Game
The concept of the game is a reversed tower defence, where the player spawns units to get past towers. The units in our game are a species called the **Colin**, a name derived from the taxonomical subfamily of the lemming. In the game, you spawn Colins, spending bark to try to reach the end of each level. To beat the game, you must complete all 10 levels and reach the Colin utopia, the **Arvicoliny**!

## Where to Play
The game is currently available at our [itch.io page](https://cwru-eecs290.itch.io/s2019-group-9) for desktop, and will soon be available on both the App Store for iOS and Google Play Store for Andriod.
